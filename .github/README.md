# Dotfiles â€“ The bare way

This dotfiles management setup came to life thanks to the article [The best way to store your dotfiles: A bare Git repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles). I've wrote a summary of it [on my website](https://www.sglavoie.com/posts/2021/05/30/managing-dotfiles-with-git-bare-repository/) as a (self-)reference.

## What's in it for me?

Hopefully, a little inspiration. Besides that, I store configuration files for the main pieces of software I use, notably:

* Bash aliases;
* Git;
* [i3 tiling window manager](https://github.com/i3/i3) with [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks/);
* Kitty terminal;
* [Scripts](.local/bin) to manage microphone output, monitor brightness, system packages and so on;
* Zsh with [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).
